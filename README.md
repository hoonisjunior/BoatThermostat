Repository contatining things needed for the patent-pending Willy Nilly single button operated thermostat controls^tm.
Aims to use a single, hardware button to control the thermostat timer on a raspberry pi.

Currently tracks left mouse input using pynput. 1 click adds 5 minutes, holding M1 for > 1 second cancels the timer.
hold M1 for >5 seconds to kill the mouse listener (or it might eat up all the processor threads)
